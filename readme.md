## SQL FOR DATA ANALYSIS

### Instructions
- You will need to follow the instructions on the next three concepts to get the Chinook database up and running on your own machine, and check that it is set up correctly. There will be two parts to this project. 

1. The first part is a series of questions that will assure you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. Though these questions will not be "graded" by a reviewer, they will help you self assess.
	
2. The second part is a presentation. Similar to the first project, there isn't a 'right answer' for the second portion of the project. You have the ability to be creative in the questions you ask. You will then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to successfully answer your question. Use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart,histogram, or another plot) that answers your question. The essentials of your project submission are discussed in the next sections. In order to review your presentation, you will need to save your slides as a PDF.
